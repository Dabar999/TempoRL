    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to maximise second-harmonic efficiency. However, since it is also very much related to the shortest possible pulse shape, we started with developing a strategy to optimise a predefinite set of control parameters so as to minimise the difference between the obtained pulse shape (in the temporal domain) and a target one (which, by default, is the shortest one typically). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since data are really expensive to empirically collect we resorted to model the underlying dynamics of the whole system, also considering that (even if not exhaustive) there is a significant amount of know-how concerned with the considered dynamics available.\n",
    "This knowledge about the actual physical process is presented in the following Figure. \n",

    "This visualisation shows how the sequence of operations that do lead to the final temporal shape is the **succession of much more elementary operations**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful when auto-differentiation can be deployed. In this particular setting because, if one represents the semiphysical model as a computational graph, then it is possible to access, very cheaply in terms of computational time and effort (and with high analytical precision), to those **differential information** which are crucial to **apply methods such as Newton Method or any gradient-based method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely enough, such a model is practically applicable only under the assumption that $y_3(\\nu)$ is a *good approximation* of $y_{REAL, 3}(\\nu)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily enough, various are the frameworks supporting auto-differentiation. One of this is **Pytorch**. Using it basically requires to rewrite the majority of the code present in the initial version of the semi-physical model, considering the data abstraction of this framework, i.e. **tensors** instead of **arrays**.
